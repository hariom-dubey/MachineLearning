# MachineLearning

This project is a collection of all the machine learning algorithms like-
LinearRegression, LogisticRegression, DecisionTree, KNearestNeighbour and SVM.

In this project -

1. I have created an KNN algorithm from scratch and predicted that the customer will going to purchase the car or not.
I got accuracy for the test data around 93%.

2. I have created Linear Regression algorithm from scratch using Gradient Descent for 1 & 3 input fields and predicted the output.
I got the same slopes & intercept values as sklearn LinearRegression model got for both the problems.

3. I have created Logistic Regression algorithm from scratch using Gradient Descent and predicted that the 
customer will going to purchase the car or not.
I got accuracy for the test data around 83%.

Used libraries are - Numpy, Pandas and other supporting libraries.

4. Other algorithms are also performed like Decision Tree and SVM.
